The NeetCode 150 is a comprehensive list of coding problems designed to help individuals prepare effectively for technical interviews, especially in software development. This list is curated to cover various essential topics such as arrays, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and more.

Here are some tips and strategies for practising the NeetCode 150:
Understand the Problem Statement: Before diving into coding, ensure you thoroughly understand what the problem is asking. Break down complex problems into simpler parts.
Plan Your Approach: Sketch out your approach on paper. Consider different algorithms that could solve the problem, and evaluate their time and space complexities.
Code and Test: Write clean, efficient code and test it with various test cases, including edge cases, to ensure correctness.
Review and Optimise: After solving a problem, review your solution. Compare it with others' solutions to discover more efficient or elegant approaches.
Consistent Practice: Set a daily or weekly goal to solve a certain number of problems. Consistency helps reinforce concepts and improves problem-solving skills over time.
Reflect on Mistakes: Analyse the mistakes you make and understand why they occurred. This reflection helps in avoiding similar errors in the future.
Join Study Groups: Engaging with peer groups or online forums can provide different perspectives and solutions, enhancing your learning experience.

Happy coding, and best of luck with your preparation!
